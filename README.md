`hugepages` is a small CLI for inspecting and configuring hugepages on
Linux and FreeBSD. On Linux it reports current totals, free, and reserved
counts per supported page size, reserves pages via the sysfs interface at
`/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/`, and mounts the hugetlbfs filesystem
(default `/dev/hugepages`). On FreeBSD it reserves physically contiguous
DMA buffers through DPDK's *contigmem* kernel module and reports its
state; see [Platform differences](#platform-differences).

## Install

```
pipx install hugepages
```

Or standalone (single-file, stdlib only, no pip needed):

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xnvme/hugepages/main/src/hugepages/hugepages.py \
  -o ~/.local/bin/hugepages && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/hugepages
```

## Shell completion

```
hugepages --print-completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/hugepages
```

Open a new shell (or `source` the file) and tab-completion is live: `hugepages <TAB>` lists `info setup mount`.

## Usage

```
$ hugepages --help
usage: hugepages [-h] [--version] [--verbose] [--print-completion SHELL]
                 {info,setup,mount} ...

Inspect and manage Linux/FreeBSD hugepages

positional arguments:
  {info,setup,mount}
    info                Show hugepage status and capabilities
    setup               Configure hugepage pool
    mount               Mount hugetlbfs

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --verbose             Enable verbose logging
  --print-completion SHELL
                        Print shell completion script to stdout and exit
```

A few common invocations:

```
hugepages info                                  # current pool state + supported sizes
sudo hugepages setup --count 512                # reserve 512 pages at the smallest supported size
sudo hugepages setup --size 2048 --count 1024   # reserve 1024 x 2 MiB (explicit size)
sudo hugepages mount                            # mount hugetlbfs at /dev/hugepages
```

1 GiB hugepages are only available if the kernel was booted with
`default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=N` on the cmdline; the
kernel reserves the 1 GiB pool at boot, and `hugepages setup` cannot
enable that size after the fact. `hugepages info` lists the sizes the
running kernel actually supports.

`hugepages info` sample output (pool not yet reserved):

```
Hugepage Support:
  Size: 2048kB  Total: 0  Free: 0  Reserved: 0
  Size: 1048576kB  Total: 0  Free: 0  Reserved: 0
```

## Allocation paths

On Linux, `hugepages setup` reserves pages in the kernel pool.
Programs that allocate via `memfd_create(..., MFD_HUGETLB)` or
`mmap(..., MAP_HUGETLB)` draw directly from the pool; no filesystem is
needed. Modern DPDK and custom xNVMe/uPCIe code take this path.

`hugepages mount` additionally mounts the `hugetlbfs` pseudo-filesystem
(default `/dev/hugepages`). Programs that want file-backed hugepages
with named-page semantics open and mmap files under the mountpoint.
SPDK and classic DPDK with `--huge-dir` use this path.

## Platform differences

Linux and FreeBSD expose large pages through different models, so the same
subcommands behave differently per platform:

| Command | Linux | FreeBSD |
| ------- | ----- | ------- |
| `info`  | totals/free/reserved per size from `/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/` | contigmem load state, buffer count/size, and physical addresses via `sysctl hw.contigmem` |
| `setup` | reserves pages in the kernel pool via sysfs | sets the contigmem tunables and (re)loads the module; `--count 0` unloads it |
| `mount` | mounts `hugetlbfs` (default `/dev/hugepages`) | informational. Buffers are `mmap`'ed from `/dev/contigmem`, there is no filesystem |

FreeBSD has no hugetlbfs and no reserved hugepage pool. Pinned,
physically contiguous memory for DMA comes from the *contigmem* kernel
module that ships with DPDK. `pkg install dpdk25.11` installs it as
`/boot/modules/contigmem.ko`. The package name carries the DPDK version. `hugepages setup --size <kB> --count <n>`
sets the module's tunables (`hw.contigmem.buffer_size`,
`hw.contigmem.num_buffers`) and (re)loads it. Buffer sizes must be a
power of 2; `--size` defaults to 524288 kB (512 MB), matching the
module's own default. Because the tunables are read only at load time,
resizing reloads the module, and unloading fails while a process still
has buffers mapped.

`setup` prints the `/boot/loader.conf` lines that make a reservation
persistent across reboots. Loading at boot is also the most reliable way
to get large contiguous runs before physical memory fragments:

```
hw.contigmem.num_buffers=2
hw.contigmem.buffer_size=1073741824
contigmem_load="YES"
```

Applications consume the buffers by `mmap(2)`-ing `/dev/contigmem`;
buffer *i* sits at offset `i * hw.contigmem.buffer_size`.
